# Encryption-decryption-program
A cool script that generates a random key, used to encrypt and decrypt.
The keys are very long, such that it's astronomically unlikely that any specific key twice.

The program allows the user to encrypt a message and then to decrypt one.

If you encrypt a string of text, copy the encrypted message and then decrypt it, you will get the original message decrypted, proving the program works.
